Answer: c)Storing class metadata, such as classes and methods

Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?
Answer: Garbage Collection is neccessary because it clear the unused objects memory in java. Free the space which is unused for better perfoemance as well as so that memory doesn't get full.

12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?

13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?

14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
Answer: Heap stores the global variable and have dynamic memory allocation and stack stores the lical variable and have a static memory allocation .

15. Write a Stack Program.
Answer: class Stack {
    private int maxSize;
    private int[] stackArray;
    private int top;

    public Stack(int size) {
        maxSize = size;
        stackArray = new int[maxSize];
        top = -1;
    }

    public void push(int value) {
        if (top < maxSize - 1) {
            stackArray[++top] = value;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack overflow");
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        if (top >= 0) {
            return stackArray[top--];
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack underflow");
            return -1; 
        }
    }
}

public class Stack1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack s = new Stack(5);

        s.push(1);
        s.push(2);
        s.push(3);

        System.out.println("Popped element: " + s.pop());
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + s.pop());

    }
}
