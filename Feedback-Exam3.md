-Nicely implemented, instead of String use Enum for Zone, all across the implementation.
-Zone must be defined as Enum types instead of String.
-Naming of variables, must be better i.e. instead of book1, book2,b, a1,a2,o1, o2.. it must be meaningful name. This applies to entire solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
